# DATETASKS TODO APP

A todo app that can sort the task date wise and add or edit task for each dates. It is good for daily tasks especially for software developers..
I invite all code geeks to contribute to this project

## Tech
- Svelte
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Daisy-Ui

# create-datedesk todo app

Follow below instructions to try it in your machine.

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
git clone git@github.com:jithutj/datetasks.git

# create a new project in my-app
cd projectfolder
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
